# Mendel's Punnett Square

## Design Considerations
Since someone went to the trouble of creating a [template](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/72ec9d6e-332d-4c4a-6e51-635e283255ee-04dd/), I wanted to try to match it as closely as possible.  

Making the app responsive for various screen resolutions suggested the use of [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for layout.

## Development Considerations

The spec stated that the various output displays (the grid, the graph and the genotypic ratio) needed to all respond to the same user inputs.  This requirement suggests some sort of state management.  While I considered using [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) (which is awesome, especially for large projects), this app was simple enough that [React](https://reactjs.org/)'s state management would do the job.  

Finally, I used [canvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/) to build the chart, since the documentation had examples of react integration.

## Future Improvements

It's perfect!  Har har.  I kid.

One thing that bothered me was the orientation of the buttons when I made the screen narrow (basic mobile device testing).  At first I considered a script that would dynamically change the flex direction of the vertically arranged buttons depending on the screen width.  I later realized that on a small device (e.g. a phone), pressing one of many small buttons would be annoying, regardless of their layout.  A better solution would be to convert the button groups into html drop-down menus when the screen is a certain size - most phones have a way of making html form elements more user friendly.  Alas, there wasn't time to implement this solution.

## Installation

To run this app, you will need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).

###`npm start`
You may get an SSL error from running an old version of Node.  You can solve this quickly by setting an environment variable thusly:
###`export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
and then running
###`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

If that doesn't work, I have included a production build in the build folder. (I don't usually put compiled code in a repo, but I want to make sure you can run this app.)  In this case, try running it with
 
```
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

If you still can't run the app, feel free to shoot me an email.

## Thanks!

I had fun writing this little demo - and I learned a whole lot about Mendel, too.  Extraordinary guy.
